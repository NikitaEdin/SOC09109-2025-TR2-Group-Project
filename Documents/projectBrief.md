# Web app for drone operations

## Overview
<p>
Edinburgh Napier University holds an operational authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority
to use drones for research purposes. Using drones can be a risky activity and the recommended
process for organising a drone operation is broken into several stages. Currently, the University's
procedures are based on a set of Word templates which is not particularly convenient. Some
information is duplicated on different forms, there is no validation, and tracking an operation
through its various stages is difficult.
</p>

<p>
This project aims to replace the current system of Word documents with a bespoke web app
based on Python Flask. A relational database will be used to streamline the data required for an
operation to reduce the effort required and eliminate inconsistencies. The system will
implement role-based security, differentiating between administrators, remote pilots and other
users. It will also be able to export data in Excel and PDF format.
</p>

<p>
If time allows, the project will also implement single sign-on via the University's Shibboleth
infrastructure. That would require good Linux skills and would need to be done in close
cooperation with the Information Services department.
</p>

<p>
The University's operations manual documents the current process and provides access to the
Word templates.
